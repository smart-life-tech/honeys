Sure, here's an example README for a project using the code provided:

```markdown
# Audio Comparison

This Python script compares a live audio recording with a reference audio file using cross-correlation. It uses the PyAudio library for recording and Librosa for audio processing.

## Installation

Before running the script, make sure to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pyaudio librosa
pip install numpy
pip install pyaudio
pip install sounddevice
```

## Usage

1. Replace `'reference_audio.wav'` with the path to your reference audio file.

2. Run the script:

```bash
python audio_comparison.py
```

The script will record live audio for a specified duration (default is 5 seconds) and compare it with the reference audio. The maximum correlation index will be printed, indicating the similarity between the recorded and reference audio.

## Customization

You can customize the script by adjusting the following parameters:

- `reference_file`: Path to the reference audio file.
- `seconds`: Duration of the live audio recording.
- Other parameters in the PyAudio setup (e.g., `sample_rate`, `frames_per_buffer`).

Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific use case or integrate it into your project.
